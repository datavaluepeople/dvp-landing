Using state-of-the-art reinforcement learning, we make autonomous optimised pricing decisions at scale in near real-time. Our algorithms balance exploiting well performing strategies vs exploring new ones.

Previous client: B2C car rental resale company; www.cartrawler.com
Value delivered: double-figure uplift (%) in revenue, sales, & profit on large sections of business traffic.


Automated Anomaly Detection 

Ingesting hundreds of business-critical data streams, running automated detection algorithms every minute/hour/day, which then trigger alerts of critical issues & behaviour changes directly to business stakeholders.

Previous client: online travel agent; www.loveholidays.com
Value delivered: +€1,000,000s each year in avoided losses due to early detection of issues.


Advanced Forecasting & Prediction 

Predictive modelling on the likelihood that rail development projects will go over budget. Using predictions for better targetedAutomated Anomaly Detection investigation & monitoring.

Previous client: UK government, Office of Rail & Road
Value delivered: high-value savings in being able to target high-risk projects, and catching development issues early

		<div>1. Scoping & Consulting

Timeline: Single sprint
On-site analysis of the organisation’s current data leverage methods, and producing recommendations on likely high-impact projects. 
→ (next stage)


2. Proof of Value

Timeline: Multiple sprints over 1-2 months
Combining initial proof-of-concept machine learning modelling, with evidence based and data led investigation, we establish the expected value & ROI of the complete end system. 
→ (next stage)
3. Automated Data-driven Systems

Timeline: iterative sprints over 2+ months
Full hands-on development, in collaboration with internal employees, we build, deliver, and handover, complete end-to-end systems, that through machine learning and automated-decision-making deliver measurable and long lasting value. 




Whether your priorities are customer acquisition, revenue, reducing costs, or profit; we’re not satisfied until we can tell you exactly how much value we’ve generated for you.
