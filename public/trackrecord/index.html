		<div>  Autonomous Optimisation

Using state-of-the-art reinforcement learning, we make autonomous optimised pricing decisions at scale in near real-time. Our algorithms balance exploiting well performing strategies vs exploring new ones.

Previous client: B2C car rental resale company; www.cartrawler.com
Value delivered: double-figure uplift (%) in revenue, sales, & profit on large sections of business traffic.


  Automated Anomaly Detection 

Ingesting hundreds of business-critical data streams, running automated detection algorithms every minute/hour/day, which then trigger alerts of critical issues & behaviour changes directly to business stakeholders.

Previous client: online travel agent; www.loveholidays.com
Value delivered: +€1,000,000s each year in avoided losses due to early detection of issues.


  Advanced Forecasting & Prediction 

Predictive modelling on the likelihood that rail development projects will go over budget. Using predictions for better targeted investigation & monitoring.

Previous client: UK government, Office of Rail & Road
Value delivered: high-value savings in being able to target high-risk projects, and catching development issues early
